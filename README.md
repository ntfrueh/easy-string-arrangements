# Easy String Arrangements - A MEAN Stack SPA Starter Project

## Now ported to FireBase!



This application was developed by Nate Frueh to promote his dad's sheet music website. It was developed using Chris' (From Scotch.IO) generator a _very_ long time ago, and has finally been published to easystringarrangements.com.

However, there are still some modifications that may be made in the future (including better SEO optimization, user authentication, etc.) This repository will help to serve as a way to work across platform to keep files up-to-date (Nate learned his lesson trying to use his private NextCloud server as a version control medium..._yeesh_...)

## To Install...
1. Download the repository
2. Install npm modules: `npm install`
3. Install bower dependencies `bower install`
4. Copy the db.js file from your cloud storage to /config/ (included in .gitignore cause it's got _secrets_...)
5. Start up the server: `firebase serve`
6. View in browser at http://localhost:5000

Big thanks to Chris @ [chris@scotch.io](mailto:chris@scotch.io) for the generator!
